## H-IPS implementation code, combining MLT and FP methods.
### The main file is H-IPS.ipynb if you are using the Jupyter notebook or H-IPS.py for other development interface.
### The FP.py is used to estimate the position through KNN algorithm.
### The DatabaseAVG.csv is the database of the Fingerprinting method.
### The file TrajetoriaGeral.csv has the points of the projected path.
### The KF_FP and KF_MLT are the Kalman Filter implementation for each technique
### The AOI.py is responsible to limit the estimated positions inside the environment dimensions.
